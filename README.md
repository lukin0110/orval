# Orval (beta)

A Python package containing a small set of utility functions not found in Python's standard library. It is lightweight, written in pure Python, and has no dependencies.

Why is it named `orval`? Because other utility names are boring and it's a tasty [Belgian beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Brewery) 🤘❤️

## 🚀 Using

To install this package, run:
```bash
pip install orval
```

Example usage:
```python
from orval import camel_case
camel_case("Great scott")
# Output: greatScott
```

```python
from orval import kebab_case
kebab_case("Great Scott")
# Output: great-scott
```

```python
from orval import snake_case
snake_case("Great Scott")
# Output: great_scott
```

```python
from orval import slugify
slugify("Great scott !! 🤘")
# Output: great-scott
# Slightly different from kebab_case, slugify is a good fit for URL paths or infrastructure resource names.
```

```python
from orval import chunkify
chunkify([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)
# Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

```python
from orval import pretty_bytes
pretty_bytes(1000)
# Output: 1.00 KB (The "human" decimal format, using base 1000)
pretty_bytes(1000, "bs")
# Output: 1000.00 B (Binary format, using base 1024)
pretty_bytes(20000000, "dl", precision=0)
# Output: 20 Megabytes
pretty_bytes(20000000, "dl", precision=0)
# Output: 19 Mebibytes
```
